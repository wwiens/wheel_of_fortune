Zip up your jacket
The zoo is fun
I'm feeling dizzy
Zebra stripes are unique
Don't make noise
Crazy weather outside today
Mom, it's freezing outside!
He's always so lazy
I'm busy, can't play
The pizza is delicious
The lizard is fast
He was dazzled momentarily
The zip is stuck
Fuzzy socks are warm
The music is zesty
The maze seemed endless
I'm out of buzzers
The size is perfect
That jazz tune grooves
Stop snoozing, wake up
Zoom in on that
The lizard is camouflaged
I'm in a daze
The zinnias are blooming
The pizza is sizzling
I'm feeling zealous today
Zany antics make me laugh
He's crazier than ever
The zippers are stuck
I'm so thirsty, zing me
That buzz is annoying
Zone out for relaxation
The hazy sunset disappears
The cozy blanket comforts
The act was buzzworthy
Zest adds flavor nicely
Be quick, no time
He always snoozes in
Pizza toppings with zest
The lizard is cold-blooded
That's totally zonkers, man
Gaze at the zodiac
I'm feeling a bit zapped
Give me some pizza
That's my dazzling 
The fireworks mesmerized 
There's a buzzing bee
He's a total zealot
Find the hidden zipper
I'm in awe-struck 
Time to get zesty
His laziness annoys 
Let's play some jazz
The lizard is small
The zipper is broken
That pizza smells delicious
I'm feeling the blues
A breeze grazed my face
She's so jazzy today
The lizard is green
He's always so zoned
The music made me zing
The buzzing was irritating
The pizza is heavenly
Life is a maze
Zinnias are my favorite
Don't snooze too long
I'm feeling pretty zapped
The lizard is scaly
The zipper is stuck
That pizza tastes amazing
The jazz band rocks
Zapping bugs with lightning
The bees are buzzing
I'm in a daze
Add some zest, please
The lizard is quick
The zipper is open
The jungle is zesty
I'm feeling quite lazy
Eat that delicious pizza
The jazz club is lively
Zapping with electric lightning
The buzzing was deafening
This pizza is mouthwatering
The zebra is striped
I'm feeling the heat
The lizard is agile
Fix the zipper urgently
The party's a buzz
I'm feeling a buzz
Watch the zebra run
That pizza is spicy
The jazz musicians harmonize
Zapping away pesky flies
The bees are swarming
I'm feeling disoriented, zapped
The lizard is elusive
The zipper is missing
The pizza is scrumptious

 We need to hurry
 She has long hair
 I love roller coasters
 The music is loud
 Stop making noise
 He won the game
 I hate spiders too
 My shoe is untied
 Can I have that?
 The river flows calmly
 The picture is crooked
 Put your shoes on
 Do your homework now
 She is a genius
 Don't drop the ball
 He whispered in French
 The baby is sleeping
 The plants need sunlight
 Let's go explore caves
 We need to workout
 The bus is late
 She loves pizza too
 The water is cold
 The sun is shining
 Please don't smoke
 They were very upset
 I lost my wallet
 Can you pass that?
 The airplane flew high
 Please don't wake me
 The dog wagged happily
 Let's go swimming
 The fish swam silently
 I love fresh fruit
 The plants need water
 She always wears purple
 Can I help you?
 Stop playing video games
 She plays soccer well
 We should go camping
 XYZ is meaningful alphabet
 I am extremely happy
 Keep it simple stupid
 Wow, what a view!
 Please keep quiet, sir
 I don't like spiders
 Take your pick, sir
 This is my zone
 I want more pizza
 Do you have Wi-Fi?
 I can't find Xanax
 Please don't wake me
 You are my world
 Let's go explore now
 Zip it, you fool!
 X-ray results look good
 Stop, you're hurting me!
 Wake up, lazybones! 
 Put that knife away!
 Get off your phone!
 The zoo is closing
 I need my glasses
 Be quiet, please
 Max is my friend
 Please pass the ketchup
 Can you kiss me?
 Wax the car today
 I took your advice
 I'm working really hard
 Can I have popcorn?
 Keep the change, please
 Look! A shooting star
 Grab a pizza slice
 I'm feeling extremely tired
 I'm hungry for breakfast
 Please lock the door
 Show more compassion, please
 Do you like pizza?
 Don't interrupt me again
 You are my princess
 Get lost, forever! 
 What’s on TV tonight?
 Can I taste that?
 Watch out for cars
 I need my wallet
 Keep the noise down
 You have my word
 Please don't hurt me
 Don’t stop me now!
 Do you have plans?
 Print the document, please
 Quit smoking, it's dangerous
 I can't believe it!
 Your zipper is undone
 I can explain everything
 You make me happy
 Please don't leave
